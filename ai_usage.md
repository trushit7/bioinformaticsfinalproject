#AI Usage Disclosure

AI tools (ChatGPT) were used in this project only for:

Structuring the initial notebook layout

Improving clarity of documentation and written sections

Helping format the Methods, Results, and Discussion text

Suggesting non-critical code optimizations

All numerical outputs—including accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, ROC curves, feature importances, and confusion matrices—were generated directly from running the code written by the group. All model decisions, code debugging, and validation were performed manually by the team.

#Verification

Each AI-suggested code block was executed, tested, and verified for correctness

Outputs were cross-checked with manual calculations or sklearn-known defaults

No AI-generated results were accepted without verification

#Ethical Considerations

The dataset is publicly available and contains no personal health identifiers

No clinical decisions are implied by this analysis

All scripts are reproducible using the provided notebook and environment logs
